              It’s important to keep you engine well-tuned to prolong its life, maintain good fuel economy, and get the performance you expect. Generally, following the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule will keep you vehicle in top shape. But if you have any concerns with what really needs attention, or don’t know when to schedule your next service, we’ll take care of everything. We will perform a check-up (free of charge) so you don’t have to worry about. 
              <br></br>
              Avoid major maintenance jobs and costly repairs that may result if left left unattended. Let us take a look at your vehicle and run precision diagnostics so you can save yourself the headache and expenses down the road. If you don’t perform routine maintenance yourself, or are unsure when you should schedule your next service appointment, then come in to Jay’s and we'll make sure your engine stays up and running at its full capacity.
